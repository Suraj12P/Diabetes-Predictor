# **Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on health parameters such as glucose level, insulin, age, and BMI. Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to select the best-performing model, which is then deployed using a Flask web application.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which is publicly available on **Kaggle**. It contains medical diagnostic measurements for predicting diabetes in female patients.
